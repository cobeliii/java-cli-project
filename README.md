CLI & Capstone Project
Part 1 - Initial Implementation

As an admin for a car company I would like to have system to book cars and view users.

Develop a car booking cli system.

Display a menu options to the user such as:

1️⃣ - Book Car
2️⃣ - View All User Booked Cars
3️⃣ - View All Bookings
4️⃣ - View Available Cars
5️⃣ - View Available Electric Cars
6️⃣ - View all users
7️⃣ - Exit

When booking a new car you should your system should ask for:

    the user id. Each user must have unique identifier (id) which must be generated by the system.
    the car to be booked

There is no right or wrong implementation have a think about the functionality and how you want your system to behave.

Think about the POJOs classes you might need such User, Car, Booking etc...

Think about the service classes you might need for business logic...

Make sure to use packages to organize your code.

User the right naming conventions. for classes, methods and packages
danger

IMPORTANT - You must use Arrays to hold any data. Do not use Lists at this point. We will later.
danger

IMPORTANT - Do not use dependency injection just yet. We will later
note

Feel free to have static data already present in your system. In the code snippet bellow UserDao returns 2 users when getUsers() is invoked. You can do the same for Cars. This is not true for bookings though.

package com.amigoscode.user;import java.util.UUID;public class UserDao {    private static final User[] users;    static {        users = new User[]{                new User(UUID.fromString("8ca51d2b-aaaf-4bf2-834a-e02964e10fc3"), "James"),                new User(UUID.fromString("b10d126a-3608-4980-9f9c-aa179f5cebc3"), "Jamila")        };    }    public User[] getUsers() {        return users;    }}

Generating random ids for users.

You can use integers or use UUID class - https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/UUID.html

You can also use https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4 to get a random string UUID and to convert it to UUID type use UUID.fromString("8ca51d2b-aaaf-4bf2-834a-e02964e10fc3")
Part 2 - Interfaces

For the method that allows you to get all users. I.e:

package com.amigoscode.user;import java.util.UUID;public class UserDao {    private static final User[] users;    static {        users = new User[]{                new User(UUID.fromString("8ca51d2b-aaaf-4bf2-834a-e02964e10fc3"), "James"),                new User(UUID.fromString("b10d126a-3608-4980-9f9c-aa179f5cebc3"), "Jamila")        };    }    @Override    public User[] getUsers() {        return users;    }}

Change your implementation such that getUsers is an override from an interface.

Example

I changed UserDao from a class to an interface

package com.amigoscode.user;

import java.util.UUID;
public interface UserDao {
    User[] getUsers();
}

Now UserArrayDataAccessService is what was class UserDao but it implements the above interface.

Run your program and test your changes

package com.amigoscode.user;

import java.util.UUID;

public class UserArrayDataAccessService implements UserDao {

    private static final User[] users;

    static {
        users = new User[]{
                new User(UUID.fromString("8ca51d2b-aaaf-4bf2-834a-e02964e10fc3"), "James"),
                new User(UUID.fromString("b10d126a-3608-4980-9f9c-aa179f5cebc3"), "Jamila")
        };
    }

    @Override
    public User[] getUsers() {
        return users;
    }
}

Finally you need to create a new UserDao implementation that will get users from a file instead of private static final User[] users.

Put the file under src/com/amigoscode/users.csv

getUsers method must read parse and return an array with contents from src/com/amigoscode/users.csv
Part 3 - Dependency Injection

Use dependency injection throughout your codebase.

I.e

From

public class CarBookingService {    private final CarBookingDao carBookingDao = new CarBookingDao();    private final CarService carService = new CarService();}

public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        CarBookingService carBookingService = new CarBookingService();    }}

To

public class CarBookingService {        private final CarBookingDao carBookingDao;    private final CarService carService;    public CarBookingService(CarBookingDao carBookingDao, CarService carService) {        this.carBookingDao = carBookingDao;        this.carService = carService;    }}

public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        CarBookingDao carBookingDao = new CarBookingDao();        CarDAO carDAO = new CarDAO();        CarService carService = new CarService(carDAO);        CarBookingService carBookingService = new CarBookingService(carBookingDao, carService);    }}

Part 4 - Lists

Switch from Array to Array List.

There is a lot of code to be changed but it will simplify things.

Here is my commit: https://github.com/amigoscode/java-master-class/commit/7454dbfb898c8b15d8c6af225203d84c9c11119f
Part 5 - Streams

5️⃣ - View Available Electric Cars

for this option you might have a method like this:

public List<Car> getAllElectricCars() {    List<Car> cars = getAllCars();    if (cars.size() == 0) {        return Collections.emptyList();    }    List<Car> electricCars = new ArrayList<>();    for (Car car : cars) {        if (car.isElectric()) {            electricCars.add(car);        }    }    return electricCars;}

The above method can be reduced to 6 lines of code instead of 16
